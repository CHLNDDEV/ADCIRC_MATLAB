#Distmesh
- Use the files in the current directory plus the following sources to run MATLAB code:

  Distmesh source: http://persson.berkeley.edu/distmesh/

  InPolygon C MEX source: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20754-fast-inpolygon-detection-mex

  m_map: https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html

- You need to have some bathymetric dataset, e.g. global SRTM30_Plus.
Ask William Pringle for details on NETCDF version. 

- You need to have made a .map file created  in SMS which describes the coastlines, ocean boundaries, and islands
(or you may use an arbitrary polygon created in MATLAB)
